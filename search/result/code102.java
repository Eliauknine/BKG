As reminder, jump link is way to graphically improve the way how 2 edges intersect. This new type is graphically represented by blank line instead of the classical &#8220;jump&#8221;. This new type is documented in the   <a href="user/diagrams/Diagrams.html#Appearance">Appearance</a> section of edge Properties view. }
