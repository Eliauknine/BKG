 <h2 id="createBasic">Create Basic Function Block</h2>{ <!--********************--><h3 id="changeInterface">Change the Interface</h3> <p>The Basic FB already has some inputs and outputs which are commonly used. If you need another, just drag and drop it from the Palette into the FB or right-click at the FB to set another input or output. Of course you can also delete them by pressing the Delete key or right-click &rarr; Delete.</p> <p>In this example, we are doing Blinking Function Block.  This should have then one input event that triggers the change, one output event as an indicator of change, and Boolean data output for the state. <br>By default, the Boolean output is set to <i>false</i> and remembers the state until new event comes in and converts the Boolean to <i>true</i> until the next input arrives. <br>Right now, the Basic FB has more inputs and outputs than we need.</p> <ol>  <li>Select the INIT event, and delete it. Do the same for QI and INITO.</li>  <li>Select the QO output, and change its name to STATE by either double-clicking on it, or in the Properties below.  		You can change the Comment for each event and data also in the Properties.</li>  <li>Check that the Type of STATE is BOOL in Properties.</li>  <li>Check the lines between events and data which represent the WITH.  	    They indicate which data outputs are refreshed when an Event occurs.  	    Similarly work event and data inputs, but in this case there's no data input to refresh.  	    Since the STATE is changed when CNF is triggered, there's WITH line between them.</li>  <li>Try and add Events and different types of Data input and outputs to the interface to play around from the Palette.  	    Finally, leave it again as in the image.</li> </ol> <img src="../../html/4diacIDE/img/Step4/createBasicInterface.png" alt="Create Basic Type - Interface"/> }
