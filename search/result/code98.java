 <h2 id="sirius6.1.0">Changes in Sirius 6.1.0</h2>{  </li> <li><span class="label label-info">IMPORTANT</span> Please note that starting from version 6.1, Sirius is now licensed under <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/" target="_blank">version 2.0 of the Eclipse Public License</a>, which updates some wording and clarifies some points but neither changes the open-source nature of Sirius nor the implications of using or embedding it. See <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/faq.php" target="_blank">the official FAQ</a> for details about the difference between EPL v1.0 (which was used before) and v2.0.</li>  </ul>  <h3 id="UserVisibleChanges6">User-Visible Changes</h3>  <ul>  <li><span class="label label-success">Added</span> A new preference has been added in the Sirius preference panel. It allows Sirius to ask the user if he wants to save session resources after an automatic migration. If the new preference is ticked, the pop-up will only appear for session opening caused by direct action of the user (i.e. opening diagram or unfolding the resources in the model explorer). You can refer to the   <a href="user/general/Modeling%20Project.html#Migration">user documentation </a> for more details. }
